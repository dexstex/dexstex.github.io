  <h1>Tale of Mbpsjohnathan</h1>
  <p>HttpsJohnathan now known as MbpsJohnathan, real name Johnathan Lamb living in Texas, United States is a racist,
    immature, homophobe, narcissist, and a pedophile. So we’ll start from the beginning. In the past he was known as
    HttpsJohnathan, on his old account he created a lot of drama and mess on different communities, not only tweaking
    communities but Minecraft communities too.</p>

  <h3>Chapter I : Identity - MbpsJohnathan</h3>
  <p>So after receiving a lot of backlash from different communities, Johnathan finally decided to abandon his
    “HttpsJohnathan” account and created a new discord account called “MbpsJohnathan”. From there, he decided to reach
    to The World Of PC, to apologize for whatever happened in the past, The World Of PC did forget him for the past, he
    purchased the toolkit license from him and after a while he gained the trust or “donated” The World Of PC to gain
    his trust and get promoted to be a "moderator" in his server. After a few months, everything seemed fine and
    Johnathan seemed like a changed person but bad habits die hard, Johnathan started engaging into useless and
    pointless arguments with random server members, abusing his moderation powers to timeout, kick and even ban members
    who didn't agree with him. Mostly it was at the time when The World Of PC would be or most of the moderation staff
    would be asleep so that nobody stops his power abuse.</p>

  <h3>Chapter II : The NotroDan Controversy</h3>
  <p>Minecraft YouTuber NotroDan who tests Custom ISOs decided to post a review on Nexus LiteOS, he mentioned about the
    OS and how good it is but the backlash from other communities wasn’t justified at all, for some reason big
    communities (don’t want to mention names) started another drama saying that NotroDan probably got paid by the Nexus
    community for the review and the OS isn’t that great but that just created a new opportunity for Johnathan too. He
    joined Notro’s server and claimed false things like calling random users on Notro’s server a Pedophile, saying that
    he is the part of the team working behind the OS, when in reality it’s just The World Of PC who has ever worked on
    his OS or the Toolkit. He claimed that he’s the lead dev and Administrator on the server and other communities are
    just racist, toxic and spreads malware when in reality he was the one making our community toxic, eventually he got
    banned from Notro’s Administration staff for uselessly engaging into arguments. After having a conversation with
    NotroDan, The World Of PC was able to take down the video but the trolls didn’t stop, they thought it was because
    NotroDan realized that the OS is bad or something.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>As a result, NotroDan removed the part where he mentions about his Minecraft Configs and also removed his
      pinned comment off of his channel.</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter III : Pedophilia</h3>
  <p>One day The World Of PC and his friends were in the VC playing some games and all, Johnathan joined the call and
    started introducing himself to everyone present in the call, then he finds a girl (name anonymous for obvious
    reasons) she is underage (14y/o) and Johnathan is/was fully aware of it at the time when they met, after a few more
    meetings Johnathan seemed really attracted towards that girl and he even agreed that he likes her and would like to
    date her. Eventually he did ask out her and offered her nitro to have matching pfps with her. She obviously denied
    that after getting the Nitro and he gets offended by that and ends up blocking her, but that’s not the end of the
    story, after a few weeks he unblocks her and gets into talking terms with her, looking for a second chance. He even
    mentions that he was stroking his dick while talking, and explains how much of a creep he is.

  <p>He also texted that girl he would fly over to her place just to meet her in real life. A whole lot of “I love you”,
    “Sleep with me in the VC”, “Show me your pictures” and the list goes on. Screenshots available in the “Behavior”
    folder.</p>

  <h3>Chapter IV : Downfall</h3>
  <p>This is the part where it all comes to an end, an end to Johnathan’s hypocrisy, immature behavior, toxicity,
    homophobia, racism and his big mouth. As usual, he started banning and timing out server members because they were
    not agreeing with him, and this time it wasn’t just some random server members, but the moderation staff/friends of
    The World Of PC. WPC took away the permissions from Johnathan to not escalate things. Johnathan gets really mad
    about that single role and threatens WPC to “crack” his toolkit apparently (lol). “I have better things to do, you
    decided to take sides with those faggots, you lost a good friend” ~John’s words. Yet he kept arguing with us for 3
    hours straight, and created a lot of group chats with people he apparently “bribed” to take his side. Overall this
    guy thinks money can buy everything. At the end of the conversation when he had nothing to say he came up with an
    accusation that all of The World Of PC’s ISOs are based on AtlasOS (AtlasOS came out a long time after The World Of
    PC had his own community and his YouTube channel setup). He also mentioned that he would create an expose video
    about The World Of PC and will post it on YouTube, with guess who? With the help of NotroDan! (dude’s delusional, he
    doesn’t even know that Notro already got rid of him in every way possible). In the end we would just like to
    conclude that, letting Johnathan into the community was a bad decision overall, he created a lot of drama,
    controversy and spread a lot of lies which somehow, one way or the other impacted The World Of PC’s reputation.
    Currently, he’s trying to share malware in the name of “Nexus LiteOS 10.iso” which basically consists of a RATTED
    system configuration app (which is basically open source on GitHub)</p>
